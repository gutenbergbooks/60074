  <h2 class='c005'><i>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'><i>These cartoons have been reprinted in the hope that they may have
a permanent interest because of the great historical importance of the
period they encompass. In the last two or three years the world has
moved with more than its usual alacrity. It has been a history-making
epoch. There has been a war that WAS a war. There have been disasters
almost without parallel; and we have weathered as pleasant a presidential
campaign as the oldest inhabitant can remember. Mr. Roosevelt has been
insured to us for another four years and his activities in peace and in war
and in sports have been a source of unending inspiration to the cartoonist. In
addition, the nation has achieved merited glory because of the great exposition
held in St. Louis, and last, but not least, Missouri has taken it into her
head to go Republican.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>The importance of these affairs is our excuse for hoping that the cartoons
appearing in this collection may have more than an ephemeral interest,
and with respectful humility, we hereby dedicate them to that grand old man—sometimes
so foolish but always so well-meaning—our Uncle Sam.</i></p>

    <div>SOCIAL HAPPENINGS AT BIRD CENTER</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Since the war in the Far East began, there has been more or
less interest evinced by our townsmen in the great struggle.
Consequently, when some of our prominent citizens suggested
that a talk be given by Captain Fry on the subject, everybody
enthusiastically seconded the proposition. The gallant captain,
himself a keen student of military strategy, as well as a hero of
Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, and a thousand other equally noted
battles, promised to give the talk and, in fact, did give it at the
Opera House last Friday evening. Mr. Smiley Green, the
popular undertaker, introduced the speaker with a few timely
and well-chosen remarks, after which Captain Fry launched
vigorously into his subject.</p>

<p class='c006'>“First, I want to explain what has led up to the present aggravated
condition of affairs in the Far East. For many years
Russia has slowly but surely been expanding to the eastward,
until she is now in possession of all northern Asia. But she has
no outlook to the sea for her commerce, except the ice-bound
port of Vladivostok way up yonder [pointing to the map]. She
is like a great wheat field full of grain with no gate to get the
grain out. So what does she do? She decides to get a port
farther south. When Japan licked the Chinese in ’94, and
captured Port Arthur and a good part of Manchuria, Russia
gets France and Germany to protest against Japan’s retaining
Port Arthur. They protest and Japan is cheated out of the
spoils of war. Then Russia quietly leases Port Arthur from the
Chinese for twenty-five years and moves in. She doesn’t think
England will stand for her action, but England had a weak
Prime Minister, and no protest was made. Of all the nations of
the earth, Russia was the most surprised to find that she was to
be allowed to keep Port Arthur. So she proceeded to fortify and
prepared to stay a good deal longer than her lease called for.
Japan is sore, but all the powers were against her. Russia then
decides that she must have all the land between Port Arthur and
Siberia, so she proceeds to occupy Manchuria. When anybody
protested she said she was going to get out day after to-morrow,
but she didn’t calculate to. She had worked a bluff at Port
Arthur, so why not work another for Manchuria? Japan was
foxy and saw how it would come out if she didn’t step in and
register a kick. So she demands that Russia move out and
Russia says ‘Certainly,’ but when moving day came, Russia
couldn’t find the moving man. Instead of that, she moved a
few thousand soldiers in and hung up a sign, ‘We are here to
stay.’ Then Japan began to oil up her musket. ‘If Russia is
allowed to do as she pleases out here, she will soon have Japan
in the corner pocket,’ she says, ‘and Japan wants at least a little
room to roll around in. We don’t propose to have a big man
with a gun leaning up against us on the starboard side, so here’s
where we get busy.’ So Japan prepares for fight, but Russia
doesn’t think she is in earnest. She calls Japan a little pigmy
and delays rolling up her sleeve. At that moment Japan inaugurated
what Mr. Gus Figgey would call ‘Rough House’ and
lands on Russia at Port Arthur with the result that Russia wakes
up to find her solar plexus dislocated.”</p>

<p class='c006'>At this point in Captain Fry’s speech there were loud shouts of
approval, in the midst of which could be heard the voice of Gus
Figgey ringing out in strident tones, “Hot stuff, Cap.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And now what is a-goin’ to happen?” resumed Captain Fry.
“I will tell you. Japan is a-goin’ to land a couple regiments
on this what’s-its-name peninsula, destroy the railway, and cut
the line of communication to Port Arthur. Then she can plant
her siege guns on the hills back of the town and throw in a few
hundred ton of grape and canister until the garrison capitulates.
Then the Japs can march up through Manchoory, capture the
Siberian railway and in six weeks capture St. Petersburg. The
Japs already have Sayool down yonder in Corea, and can bombard
the Yayloo River when they’re a mind to.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Many of the audience congratulated Captain Fry on his address,
and assured him that they now could intelligently follow
the news from the war.</p>

and Gus Nelson, two prominent citizens of this city, report
having sighted the Vladivostok squadron last evening, steaming
slowly down the Wabash River. Both men are citizens of considerable
veracity, one having formerly been the circulation
manager of the Wabash <i>Palladium</i> and the other a prominent
politician. People here are inclined to credit the report. Mr.
Newbower states positively that he saw three large ships steaming
so near that he could distinctly see the masts. Mr. Nelson
saw six ships, having probably looked twice. Intense excitement
prevails here as there is a neutral river flatboat nine weeks
overdue. It is feared the Russian ships may have overtaken it.</p>

Breckenridge, who is spending the summer at his home in this

Kentucky shore of the Ohio yesterday afternoon. The colonel
doesn’t remember the number of ships but says the number corresponded
with that of the Russian fleet. The report can be
easily verified, says the colonel, by his grandson who also witnessed
the squadron. Great excitement prevails and the matter
is the topic of general conversation. The sheriff is organizing
a posse of colonels to guard the city in case local shipping is
threatened.</p>

of Chicago, who has been Sundaying in this city, reports seeing
the Vladivostok squadron last evening three miles east of this
city. Mr. Close was sitting on the shore thinking about the
political situation, when some one near by called his attention
to the squadron. He says that he saw it distinctly, but didn’t
notice how many ships there were, or what direction they were
going. Mr. Close states that he is going down again to-night
to watch for the squadron. Intense excitement prevails.
Little knots of bridal couples may be seen earnestly discussing
the sensation.</p>

of this city came running into the city early this morning
crying out that he had been pursued by the Vladivostok
Squadron. He first saw it near the rolling mills and stopped
for some minutes to count the ships. He counted six the first
time, but a recount showed nine. A Russian admiral commanded
him to surrender, but Mr. Bughaus retreated quickly
followed by the entire squadron. Fortunately he reached the
city safely, although terribly frightened. In an interview Mr.
B. stated that he saw the ships while on his way home or to
work, he is not sure which. Great excitement prevails.</p>

Walton Jones, a citizen of this city, reports
having sighted the Vladivostok squadron three miles and a
quarter off Cape Horn, about noon to-day. He first saw the
fleet come down the east coast of South America, turn abruptly
around the Horn and disappear rapidly up the west coast.
There were three large ships and they were traveling thirty
knots an hour. When last seen they were turning the corner
two miles north of Valparaiso. Mr. Jones at once brought the
news to this city, and, after renewing his supplies, will return to
the cape where he is fishing.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Dundee, Scotland, July 27</span>—(<span class='sc'>Special</span>)—Mr. Jem
Wethersby, first officer of the Peruvian bark Calisaya, arrived
here this afternoon with the report that he found evidences of
the Vladivostok squadron. At seven bells night before last,
while doing his trick at the watch, he passed a large piece of
wreckage which, he swears, was probably part of a vessel sunk
by the what’s-its-name squadron. Mr. Wethersby has had
much experience in swearing, having been a mate on a tramp
steamer for twelve years. Late this evening we endeavored
to get a complete story from Mr. W., but he was not to be
found.</p>

The king witnessed the charge from a safe position on the obelisk. There was quite a panic in Lombard Street, many of the leading financiers hastily retiring to Hyde Park upon hearing that the gallant colonel was to make the charge. Some of them are still missing, but doubtless will soon be found. One hundred and sixty women fainted, nineteen horses ran away, and one unfortunate man had his leg broken while trying to climb Trafalgar Monument. The dome of St. Paul’s will be repaired within the next fortnight.</i></span></p>

Patrick Mc Graw,
President Amalgamated Order of Honest Workmen.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir:—</p>
<p class='c015'>Your letter received. Personally, I consider the request that you make should more appropriately be presented to the mayor or your city. At the same time I cannot miss this opportunity to say a few things about labor organizations in general. I think organized labor is a serious menace to the welfare of our institutions; and I further think that any man who belongs to a Union should be treated as a criminal. There is no good in Unions. Every man who belongs to one is worse than an anarchist. If I am elected my first official act shall be to have every man who belongs to a labor union expelled from the country or de-naturalized.  Furthermore, I think that men who work for a living have no license to live anyway.</p>

<p class='c014'>Dear Friend:—</p>
<p class='c015'>Thanks for your very friendly letter. I am much encouraged
by the news you send and am very glad to hear that the sentiment
is so favorable to me. John D. called on me yesterday
and left a substantial check, which, of course, will not
be recorded in his name. It is needless to say that if I
am elected my gratitude will assure a very substantial form
and my friends in Wall Street need never fear that their
prosperity will be jeopardized by any official act of mine.
I shall be in New York Saturday and should like to see you
privately at the Metropolitan Club. Mr. Baer, of the Reading
Road, will also join us there.</p>

<p class='c014'>To

Washington.</p>

<p class='c014'>Dear Son-in-Law:—</p>
<p class='c015'>I shall be home Thursday. Am very tired and worn out.
I do not believe that I can keep up this pace for six
months more. My back aches, I fainted from over-exhaustion
yesterday, and the only food I can eat is pre-digested milk.
Please have Murphy, the foreman of the mine, discharge the
laborers who are agitating for higher wages. We are now
paying them 80 cents a day and what can these ignorant
German and Irish laborers expect? They never earned
that much at home and yet they dare to come over here and
make these preposterous demands. I never could tolerate
the Germans and Irish anyway. However, do not mention
this fact before election day.</p>
<p class='c016'>Yours affectionately,
Henry G Davids [** signature]</p>

If you think it over as carefully as I have you’ll soon know just as much as I do. I used to get up at three o’clock and sit in the dark thinking it out. I didn’t dare light a light for fear Mr. Yerkes would find me and sell me some stock. Finally, one morning, about half-past four I got it all thought out except where the stockholders come in, and just then Mr. Yerkes and Mrs. Chadwick rode in on two white giraffes with a trunk full of stocks. So I ran down the street yelling, and some one suggested a nice, quiet upholstered room where I would be safe. So I came here and you mustn’t tell Mr. Yerkes where I am. And now I’ve got it all thought out. You first have to multiply Port Arthur by the new Chicago Post Office and carry two. Then you subtract and let stand in a cool place until you become impatient, and that’s the answer.</i>”</span></p>

    <div>SOME HAPPY LITTLE VACATION SUGGESTIONS FOR OUR READERS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Suggestion I</span>—Charter a good, seaworthy steam-yacht,
stock it well with seasonable food and drink, and cruise along
the New England coast. Frequent stops may be made at the
various watering places, thus pleasantly breaking the voyage.
After having exhausted these points of interest, you will find it
enjoyable to continue the cruise to Sweden and Norway, and, if
your time permits, a still further cruise among the beautiful
fjords of New Zealand will be found extremely delightful. The
weather is now perfect in New Zealand, and if you have a camera
you can get some most excellent pictures. For a trip such
as this one should secure a steam-yacht of perhaps 2,500
tons, with a crew of thirty men. A white yacht is preferable,
white being cooler than black. If you do not mind
the additional expense, a cow should be taken, thus insuring
fresh milk during the voyage. As for equipment, you
should take heavy and light clothes, a pair of deck shoes,
a mackintosh, and a pair of smoked glasses to protect your
eyes while going through the Suez Canal. The cost of this
outing will amply repay you for your pleasure, and we strongly
recommend it.</p>

<hr class='c019' />

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Suggestion II</span>—Another delightful vacation which we
earnestly recommend would be to spend your two weeks’ holiday
in Scotland. Here one may rent a beautiful estate, abundantly
stocked with game—croquet, golf, bridge, etc.,—and with
plenty of good riding-horses, and at least one mail coach for
coaching parties, the hours may be most delightfully beguiled.
You could give frequent entertainments, such as jolly little tours
in the highlands, etc., and it would be well to have the castle
the scene of many congenial house parties. Occasionally you
should give lawn fêtes to which the peasants and tenants from
the neighboring countryside may be invited.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such an estate may easily be secured by going through the
necessary preliminaries. You should insist, however, that
your London agents secure a castle with a porch well screened
with mosquito bars. The cost of such a place would be either
moderate or upwards.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the highlands are often cool during the evening hours, you
should take a heavy overcoat and at least one suit of flannels.</p>

<hr class='c019' />

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Suggestion III</span>—Our third suggestion would be to make
up a jolly little party and spend your July vacation in touring
Switzerland and the Petroleum Alps. Excellent motor-cars
may be obtained in Paris (No. 19 Arc de Triomphe)
and the roads from the gay capital to the Swiss uplands
will be found most excellent. Luncheon may be secured
at convenient cabarets along the way, and by speaking to
the chauffeur stops may be made from time to time to allow
you to make photographs of choice bits in the landscape.
Arriving in Switzerland, you should retire early in
order to be up for the sunrise, which, in those latitudes is
much earlier than in America on account of the difference
in time.</p>

<p class='c006'>While in Switzerland you should not fail to visit the tomb of
William Tell, who is dead at present. Here a short stop may be
made for luncheon, photographs, etc. In this little side trip
you will have delightful weather, according to recent unconfirmed
rumors from Chefoo.</p>

<p class='c006'>Having toured Switzerland, it would be pleasant to have a yacht
meet you some place nearby and make the homeward journey in
this way rather than by the Atlantic liners. There are so many
vulgar tourists on the regular steamships during the summer.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c008'>IT is with pleasure that ye Editor chronicles the announcement that a goodly quota of
Bird Center society leaders purpose taking a European tour ere long. Among those
who will constitute the pilgrimage are Mrs. Riley Withersby, our beloved leader of
local society, Reverend Walpole and wife and children under nine years of age, Captain
Roscoe Fry and wife, Mr. J. Milton Brown and wife (née Lucile Ramona Fry, formerly
daughter of Captain Fry), and little J. Milton Brown, Jr. Also Mr. Smiley Greene, the
popular undertaker, and wife and children, Mr. Riley Peters and Miss Myrtle Prute, of
Muncie, Indiana, the Misses Flossye and Mae Niebling, Mr. Ernest Pratt, Mr. Elmer Pratt,
Mr. Wilbur Fry, and Mr. Orville Peters. Quite a goodly party, say you not?</p>

<p class='c006'>It is safe to say without exaggeration that the local social circles are agog with pleasant
anticipation. At first it was understood that only Mrs. Withersby contemplated going
abroad, and for that reason she gave a small function last evening to announce the fact, but
others volunteered to accompany her and the party grew apace quite rapidly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Late in the evening, just before refreshments were served, Mr. Gus Figgey of Chicago
arrived and joined the group.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I just came in on the hundred-hour limited from Decatur,” he announced buoyantly,
“and thought I’d drift up and join the merrymakers. What’s going on?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Withersby explained that some of the party were talking over a trip to Europe.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Count me in,” said Mr. Figgey. “I haven’t had a vacation for three years and I’m
going to have one this year if the country goes plumb to smash. What’s the route?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We have planned to go to Scotland and the English Lakes,” said Mrs. Withersby
pleasantly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I can figure out a better trip than that,” said Mr. Figgey. “First we’ll go to London
and show those Britishers a touch of high life, then skip over to Paris, thence to Venice, and
circle around to Rome. Them’s the four great show places of Europe, and no tour is complete
without ’em.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But, Mr. Figgey—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now, I’ll tell what we’ll do,” said the genial Mr. Figgey. “I’ll get some inside
rates from a friend of mine in the importing business, and I’ll guarantee that when we get
through, Europe will feel that she’s been seen good and proper.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Have you ever been abroad, Mr. Figgey?” inquired Mrs. J. Milton Brown.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, but I’ve traveled all over this country, making all the important towns, and what I
don’t know about traveling could be put in an expurgated French novel.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’d like to stop at Niagara Falls, Mr. Figgey,” said Elmer Pratt.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sure, the train slows down there and we can see the Falls just as well as if you spent an
hour.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And won’t it be beautiful in Venice,” said Miss Myrtle Prute. “I’ve always been
crazy to see Venice by moonlight.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We’ll see it by moonlight, candlelight and daylight, Miss Prute. Orville and Wilbur
can take their mandolins and we’ll have a tune on the dancing waters. Hot stuff, eh?”
said Mr. Figgey, slapping Reverend Walpole on the back.</p>

<p class='c006'>The party adjourned at a late hour, Mr. Figgey promising to arrange all the details,
etc. Various members of the party will tell their experiences exclusively in the Bird Center

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c008'>MIDST gay acclaim did the Bird Center personally conducted tour to Europe steam
out of Bird Center yesterday morn. The bells cried “Off to Europe,” and the rails
clicked the same news as the great steam steed started on the long journey to Niagara
Falls. Throngs of people got on and off at every station, and many admiring glances were
cast at the Bird Center tourists who, massed together, made quite a noticeable effect. Mr.
Gus Figgey, who says he is the chaperon of the party, has made the welkin ring with
laughter and gaiety. At the first stop he purchased oranges for the crowd, and later in the
day entertained them with personal anecdotes of travel. At the second stop Mr. Figgey addressed
the town from the rear platform, and received a rousing round of cheers. Last
evening he entertained ye Editor at supper in the dining-car. It has been a beautiful trip.</p>

<p class='c006'>Niagara Falls was reached without further mishap. These Falls are situated on the
Niagara River, between the Canadian side and the United States. They are a hundred and
sixty-two feet in height and are considered by competent critics to be one of America’s most
famous natural beauties. The train stopped twenty minutes and Mr. Figgey had several
fast hacks convey the party to the various points of interest. By way of getting an
expression of opinion from the various members of the party, the Editor secured short
statements for the readers of the <i>Argosy</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Great sight,” said Mr. Figgey. “Those Falls have power enough to run all the
factories in the U. S. A.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A notable sight,” said Mrs. Riley Withersby.</p>

<p class='c006'>“More impressive than Dante’s ‘Inferno,’” said Mrs. J. Milton Brown.</p>

<p class='c006'>“A masterpiece of Nature,” said Reverend Walpole.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Unequalled in history,” said Wilbur Fry.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Fine, but wait till you see Saint Peter’s in Rome,” said Mr. Ernest Pratt, who was in
Europe several years ago.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Too bad I can’t get a good photo of it. The Falls would make a beautiful moving
picture,” said Mr. J. Milton Brown.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Truly a sublime spectacle,” said Mr. Smiley Greene, the popular undertaker.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Gosh!” said Elmer Pratt.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was with mingled feelings of sadness that ye Editor saw the gay party steam eastward,
as he was obliged for business reasons to return to Bird Center. Other communications
from members of the party will be printed from time to time.</p>

<p class='c006'>“She moves, she throbs, she seems to feel the thrill of life upon her keel.” At last
the great Leviathan of the Deep has left the dock amid waving ‘kerchiefs and loud huzzas.
Like great mountain ranges, rising tier upon tier, the vast buildings of Gotham looked
down upon the gallant ship as she turns her course toward the vast and trackless deep.
Beautiful somber tints stretch from horizon upward, blending into the deep blue of Heaven’s
own firmament. Dainty white caps assail the towering walls of steel that are to be our
home for so many days. Bartholdi’s peerless statue, with hand uplifted, seems to cast its
benedictions on us as we start for those distant shores to the eastward, and Nature smiles
fondly upon us as America’s shores sink lower and lower, back in the direction of dear Bird
Center. What joy it is to breathe this ocean air, unsullied by smoke, undefiled by foreign
matter. Eyes are flashing with renewed invigoration, hearts are light as the giant of the
sea swings into the easy roll of the long Atlantic billows. Spindrift whips by as a great
wave, more saucy than its sisters, assails the reeling bow. The splendid craft trembles
but goes onward, ever onward, its propellers singing their endless song of struggle. Mr.
Figgey, immaculate and white-flanneled, is quite the dressiest passenger on board, and is
constantly the cynosure of all eyes. See how he swings along the deck, perfect sailor
that he is. Now the rollers batter more furiously, as Mr. Figgey approaches, cigar in
mouth, to tell us to get busy and have a good time. The ship rolls and wallows—”</p>

<i>Argosy</i> the following travel-paper from Mr. Gus Figgey, the genial
Chicago traveling man who is being accompanied by social leaders of this
City in their tour abroad.</p>
<div class='c007'><span class='sc'>J. Oscar Fisher</span>, Editor.</div>
<div class='c020'><span class='sc'>London, July —, 1842</span></div>

<p class='c006'>I have dated this back to fit the occasion. Of all the slow burgs, this is the slowest.
Had to wait three minutes for an elevator at the hotel and ten minutes longer to reach the
sixth floor. I told the Britisher at the desk what the trouble with London was, but he didn’t
believe me. Merely raised his eye-brows, but I’ll raise something else if things don’t
move along a little faster here before long. Took the bunch out for a ride in a herdic
to-day. Saw the Strand, not to be mentioned in the same year with State Street in old
Chicag. Elmer Pratt said he reckoned there must be a show in town, judging by the
crowd in the streets. Took ’em to see the Alhambra, but Reverend Walpole said it wasn’t
a bit like what he thought the Alhambra was like, judging from something he read by
Henry Irving. Have had a hard time keeping the folks <i>en masse</i>, as the Frenchies say.
Mrs. J. Milton wanted to go to a picture gallery to see the Turners, but I told her I’d take
her around to the Tivoli and show her some turns that were turns. Reverend Walpole
wanted to go to the Westminster Abbey and Saint Paul’s, but from what I heard a man on
the steamer say, they are old buildings, out of date and furnished with tombstones. When
I want any reading, you’ll have to pass me something livelier than epitaphs. Elmer Pratt
wanted to see London Bridge, he heard it was falling down. If there was a Lake Front
here, Elmer would be down there looking at the explosion. I took the party down to see
Trafalgar’s monument, and pointed it out to them. Have lost Riley Peters and Myrtle
Prute, but I suppose they’ll turn up at supper time. We’ve been here two days, and have
done the town thoroughly. Leave to-morrow for gay Paris. Can’t hold Smiley Greene.
Orville Peters and Wilbur Fry are anxious to get to Venus, where they can play their mandolins
on the raging canal. Ernest Pratt is blasé on the trip, having been over here before.
Says Europe is an old story to him. Get my name spelled right, Oscar. Be sure to get
in the “e.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c008'>THE Editor is pleased to present to the readers of the Bird Center <i>Argosy</i> the following
travel-paper from Mr. Smiley Greene, our popular undertaker, who is doing
Europe with a party of travelers from this city.</p>
<div class='c007'><span class='sc'>J. Oscar Fisher</span>, Editor.</div>
<div class='c020'><span class='sc'>Paris, August.</span></div>

<p class='c006'>In Paris, France, at last! France, the gay, the light-hearted; France, the country with
a history! Every wall has its tale of war and revolution and death. Placards reading
“Defense d’Afficher” mark where notable defenses, back in some dark days of the past,
have been made by gallant sons of Gaul. Captain Fry says Gaul is divided into three parts,
not counting Gus Figgey. Gus says some one ought to consolidate them into a union.
We have been having considerable trouble with the language, as they all speak the foreign
tongue here, so that even by shouting at the top of your lungs, you can’t make them understand.
Lucile Ramona Brown tried her French on them, but they didn’t even understand
that. She seems to get her accents on the wrong words.</p>

<p class='c006'>Paris never was more beautiful, even although we understand that most of the society
people have gone away for the summer. You can’t help pitying these Europeans, for
they can’t go abroad for the summer, being already there. Went out to visit the Morgue
to-day. Busiest place of its kind I’ve ever seen. Visited Napoleon’s tomb this afternoon,
and consider it a most imposing place. Mr. Figgey tells us that the departed is a relative
of the new United States Secretary of the Navy, a fact which has aroused great interest in
our midst. Yesterday we drove out to witness the Arch of Triumph, which was greatly
enjoyed by all save Ernest Pratt, to whom Europe is an old story, he having been here
before. To-morrow we go out to view Père la Chaise, the famous cemetery of Paris. It is
said that many well-known Frenchmen and French women sleep their last sleep out there,
so we have cautioned Gus Figgey to put on the soft pedal for a short spell. Ernest Pratt
says Abelard and Hèloise lie there, but whether they are two people or a firm I cannot
state. Visited the Louvre yesterday and saw the Venus of Milo, which greatly shocked
Elmer Pratt. Gus Figgey says her arms were guillotined during the French Revolution, but
be it as it may, she certainly is shy on arms. Orville Peters and Wilbur Fry are eager to
get to Venice to while away the hours with dulcet strains from their mandolins, but Ernest
Pratt says, “Wait till we see Saint Peter’s.” To-morrow we view the Catacombs and
the Cemetery of Montmartre.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c008'>THE Editor is pleased to present to the readers of the Bird Center
<i>Argosy</i> the following travel-paper from Mrs. J. Milton Brown, the
wife of J. Milton Brown, the well-known artist of the Bird Center
Tintype Studios.</p>
<div class='c007'><span class='sc'>J. Oscar Fisher</span>, Editor.</div>
<div class='c020'><span class='sc'>Venice The Enchanting, Aug. —</span></div>

<p class='c006'>At last we are in the well-known city of Venice, Italy, about which our fancies have
from time immemorial woven the most bewitching dreams. It is hard to realize that we are
really here. We instantly exclaim, “Can it really be true that we are in Venice, and not
merely dreaming.” Mr. Figgey—he’s so funny—says that we’ll not think we’re dreaming
when we get our hotel bill. Mr. Figgey is so material in his attitude of thought, but he
has been a perfect dear in arranging things. He doesn’t let us rest a moment, and even
now, when we have been here only two days, he seems to know all the gondoliers and
everybody in town knows him. He calls all the gondoliers “Louey,” and they begin to
grin broadly whenever he comes in sight. We had such a good joke on Elmer Pratt to-day.
We came across a little church near the hotel and Elmer went into raptures over it. It’s
whole façade was one bewildering nightmare of scroll work and curly cues, like frosting on
a wedding cake. Elmer said that he considered it the most beautiful thing he had seen in
Europe, and at once looked it up in our Baedeker. The description says that it is the most
atrociously ugly building in Europe, and since then Elmer has not admired anything
until he has looked in the guide book to see whether it is beautiful.</p>

<p class='c006'>Last night we engaged some gondolas and did the grand canal. The moon was divine,
and the whole city was throbbing with music and sentiment. Mr. Figgey directed the
excursion and after a while took charge of the oar or paddle (I don’t know what the real
name is) and gave the gondolier some lessons in the work. Smiley Greene sang some rollicking
hymns, and then we all clamored for Orville Peters and Wilbur Fry to play on their
mandolins. They had carried their instruments all the way from Bird Center and had
counted the seconds to the present moment. But scarcely had they begun to play before
some men came and said it was not permitted for outsiders to play on the canals. Only
those belonging to the Gondoliers’ Union could play. Orville and Wilbur were broken-hearted.
We had been out for some time before we discovered that Riley Peters and
Myrtle Prute were missing, but, Mr. Figgey soon located them in a gondola by themselves.
Riley seems to be in earnest this time, but now could any one help being in earnest, and in
love, in Venice. Even all of us become a little bit soft here—even us old married people.
Flossye Niebling has been spending all her time writing letters home. The stationery at the
hotels is so attractive and she doesn’t want to miss a chance to use it.</p>

travel-paper from Mr. Gus Figgey, the genial Chicago traveling gentleman,
who is traveling in Europe with society leaders from Bird Center.</p>
<div class='c007'><span class='sc'>J. Oscar Fisher</span>, Editor.</div>
<div class='c020'><span class='sc'>Rome, Aug. —</span></div>

<p class='c006'>This burg isn’t half bad. In some of the new parts of town you’d think you were in
Chicago. They have buildings here eight and ten stories high, and the old fogy part of the
city is fast disappearing. A good hustling Commissioner of Public Works could soon
make Rome look as up-to-date as any of our American cities. Rome is only about a third
as big as Chicago, although it was started long before. To-day we did two miles of picture
galleries and saw paintings which, if put together, would make one painting a mile square.
I priced some of them but didn’t buy. Reverend Walpole has been right in his element
here and has visited about ninety-seven churches. Smiley Greene has spent most of his
time in the Catacombs and J. Milton Brown and Lucile have reveled in art. The party is
all split up. They refused to go out to the Race Track with me, and I have had a hard time
entertaining them. Yesterday we all went in a bunch to see St. Peter’s. Say, there’s a
building for you. Ernest Pratt says it’s the greatest building in the world, and he’s been
in Europe before. I guess he saw it when it was new; for now it is showing signs of age.
When I got the crowd in front of the church, I had ’em stand all in a row while I went on
in front to give ’em an idea of how big the building really is. You can’t realize its size
until you compare it with a man standing at the door. They were much surprised to see
how small I looked.</p>

<p class='c006'>To-morrow we sail from Naples for New York, and before many days you will see
us drifting into Bird Center, all sound and well. Riley Peters and Myrtle Prute are engaged.
Venice and the moon did it. Riley’s hot stuff, all right.</p>

<p><span class='small'><i>For many days the way was easy, and no mishaps attended them until they arrived at the foothills of a vast mountain range. An unfortunate mishap then occurred. One of the colonels was overcome and had to be borne along on the back of his steed thereby greatly lessening the speed of the gallant little band. Despite this untoward accident, the governor led bravely onward, ever crying out: “Courage, my comrades! Courage! We shall soon be there!”</i></span></p>

<p><span class='small'><i>Thus inspired they began the ascent. A vast solitude surrounded them! No sign of life met their eye, save where some distant mountain goat disported himself on the dizzy peaks, or where some adventurous eagle clung high in the Alpine crags. The hardships of traveling now became extreme, provisions gave out and for many weeks the little cavalcade were obliged to subsist upon eagles and mountain goats, which, owing to the peculiar formation of the country were difficult to catch, and more difficult to shoot, as the colonels were unaccustomed to the use of firearms. When they reached an altitude of 19,000 feet, another colonel was overcome and had to be carried along with his stricken comrade, for the governor resolved not to abandon his devoted follower in the mountain fastness as a prey to the savage goats.</i></span></p>

<div class='ic009'>
<p><span class='small'><i>Upon the nineteenth day of the ascent the last colonel gave out, and the governor carefully placed him upon the horse parallel with the two other exhausted colonels. A few days after this fresh misfortune the little band reached the summit, 42,000 feet above the sea level. A magnificent view of the surrounding continent was obtained, and largely repaid for the hardships of the ascent. Behind lay the peaks that they had crossed, many of them rising to a height of 30,000 feet or more. Down at their feet lay the broad, convex bosom of the Atlantic Ocean. A happy thought struck the governor. “I remind myself of Balboa discovering the Pacific,” he said with a smile, but if his followers heard this merry quip they gave no heed. Then the governor’s face became grave as another thought struck him. “There is no disguising the fact that I have a long swim ahead of me,” he said resolutely.</i></span></p>

The three colonels were still in an exhausted state, and their weight greatly retarded the speed of the gallant steed, yet, strange as it may seem, the descent was made in an incredibly short time. In ten minutes the little cavalcade rode safely out on the shelving beach, and the governor urged his horse boldly into the Atlantic Ocean. “Now, for a long swim,” said he.</i></span></p>

Under these favoring conditions it was only a few days until the headlands of the Azores were sighted off the port beam. Hunger and fatigue racked the governor, but he did not stop. He shouted “Courage, my noble steed. The way is long, but we shall soon be there.” One of the colonels was revived by the cool water, and from his position amidships passed the days pleasantly in watching the wonderful dwellers of the deep as they darted hither and thither alongside. On the thirty-fourth day the governor sighted a low group of islands off to the s’uth’ard. He sniffed a moment. “The Bermudas,” he said. And he was right. They were the Bermudas where the onions come from. From this point he shaped his course nor by nor west, intending to land on American shores about four miles west of Oyster Bay. But he was thrown out of his course by adverse currents and strong head winds, and had to make his landing six miles east of Oyster Bay. Still he was not discouraged.</i></span></p>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
